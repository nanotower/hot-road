## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is my capstone project of cloud developer nanodegree at Udacity.
As a user, you can register to the app with a nickname and a picture, and then post any topic that you want to discuss or add a comment to an existing one. Inside each topic, you can see a list of relative comments and who had posted it.
In the users area, topics can be deleted or renamed.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to install first [node js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) and [AWS cli](https://aws.amazon.com/en/cli/). You will need also an AWS account.

### Installing

You can launch serverless stack with this command
```
sls deploy -v
```
Copy the https id and ws id in the given output to /front/config.js. This will connect frontend client with the services deployed in AWS.

For the frontend part, you need to install first the list of dependencies.
```
cd front
npm i

And then start the client.
```
npm run start
```

## üéà Description <a name="description"></a>

There are 4 dbs: users, topics, comments and connections.
When a user upload a profile picture, S3 saves it and notify by SNS message to a resize function that scales down the picture.
When a new topic is created, it send a ws message that tells every connected users that they have to update their topics list, so the new one can be seen.
